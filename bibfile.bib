  abstract = {Twitter sentiment analysis technology provides the methods to survey public emotion about the events or products related to them. Most of the current researches are focusing on obtaining sentiment features by analyzing lexical and syntactic features. These features are expressed explicitly through sentiment words, emoticons, exclamation marks, and so on. In this paper, we introduce a word embeddings method obtained by unsupervised learning based on large twitter corpora, this method using latent contextual semantic relationships and co-occurrence statistical characteristics between words in tweets. These word embeddings are combined with n-grams features and word sentiment polarity score features to form a sentiment feature set of tweets. The feature set is integrated into a deep convolution neural network for training and predicting sentiment classiﬁcation labels. We experimentally compare the performance of our model with the baseline model that is a word n-grams model on ﬁve Twitter data sets, the results indicate that our model performs better on the accuracy and F1-measure for twitter sentiment classiﬁcation.},

  abstract   = {The importance of quantifying the nature and intensity of emotional states at the level of populations is evident: we would like to know how, when, and why individuals feel as they do if we wish, for example, to better construct public policy, build more successful organizations, and, from a scientiﬁc perspective, more fully understand economic and social phenomena. Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we ﬁnd that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960s to the mid 1990s while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the Earth’s equator.},
